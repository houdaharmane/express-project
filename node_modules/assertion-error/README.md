## What is AssertionError?

Assertion Error is a module that contains two classes: `AssertionError`, which
is an instance of an `Error`, and `AssertionResult` which is not an instance of
Error.

These can be useful for returning from a function - if the function "succeeds"
return an `AssertionResult` and if the function fails return (or throw) an
`AssertionError`.

Both `AssertionError` and `AssertionResult` implement the `Result` interface:

```typescript
interface Result {
  name: "AssertionError" | "AssertionResult";
  ok: boolean;
  toJSON(...args: unknown[]): Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

So if a function returns `AssertionResult | AssertionError` it is easy to check
_which_ one is returned by checking either `.name` or `.ok`, or check
`instanceof Error`.
