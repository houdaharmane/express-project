## Usage

```js
const pMap = require('p-map');
const got = require('got');

const sites = [
	getWebsiteFromUsername('https://sindresorhus'), //=> Promise
	'https://ava.li',
	'https://github.com'
];

(async () => {
	const mapper = async site => {
		const {requestUrl} = await got.head(site);
		return requestUrl;
	};

 	const result = await pMap(sites, mapper, {concurrency: 2});

	console.log(result);
	//=> ['https://sindresorhus.com/', 'https://ava.li/', 'https://github.com/']
})();
```

## API

### pMap(input, mapper, options?)

Returns a `Promise` that is fulfilled when all promises in `input` and ones returned from `mapper` are fulfilled, or rejects if any of the promises reject. The fulfilled value is an `Array` of the fulfilled values returned from `mapper` in `input` order.

#### input

Type: `Iterable<Promise | unknown>`

Iterated over concurrently in the `mapper` function.

#### mapper(element, index)

Type: `Function`

Expected to return a `Promise` or value.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### concurrency

<<<<<<< HEAD
Type: `number`<br>
Default: `Infinity`<br>
=======
Type: `number` (Integer)\
Default: `Infinity`\
>>>>>>> 5feea03a860e1851f4a7432dfd45499e26af9716
Minimum: `1`

Number of concurrently pending promises returned by `mapper`.

##### stopOnError

<<<<<<< HEAD
Type: `boolean`<br>
=======
Type: `boolean`\
>>>>>>> 5feea03a860e1851f4a7432dfd45499e26af9716
Default: `true`

When set to `false`, instead of stopping when a promise rejects, it will wait for all the promises to settle and then reject with an [aggregated error](https://github.com/sindresorhus/aggregate-error) containing all the errors from the rejected promises.
